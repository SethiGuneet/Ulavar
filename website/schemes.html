        <b><p>Soil Health Card Scheme</p></b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Soil Health Card Scheme is a scheme launched by the Government of India in 19 February 2015.[1] Under the scheme, the government plans to issue soil cards to farmers which will carry crop-wise recommendations of nutrients and
              fertilisers required for the individual farms to help farmers to improve productivity through judicious use of inputs.
              The scheme aims at promoting soil test based and balanced use of fertilisers to enable farmers to release higher yields at lower cost.[3] also the main objective is to aware growers about the appropriate amount of nutrients for the
              concerned crop depending on the quality of soil.
              An amount of ₹568 crore (US$79 million) was allocated by the government for the scheme.[1] In 2016 Union budget of India, ₹100 crore (US$14 million) has been allocated to states for making soil health cards and set up labs.
              The target for 2015–16 is to collect 100 lakh soil samples and test these for issue of soil health cards.[5] 2 crore cards are under printing and will be distributed before March 2016.[5] The government plans to distribute 12 crore
              soil cards by 2017.

        <p><b>Schemes under NMSA</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p> RAD is being implemented by RFS Division RAD adopts an area based approach for development and conservation of natural resources along with farming systems. This component has been formulated in a ‘watershed plus framework’, i.e., to
              explore potential utilization of natural resources base/assets available/created through watershed development and soil conservation activities /interventions under MGNREGS, NWDPRA, RVP&FPR, RKVY, IWMP etc.. This component introduces
              appropriate farming systems by integrating multiple components of agriculture such as crops, horticulture, livestock, fishery, forestry with agro based income generating activities and value addition. </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p> SHM is being implemented by INM Division. SHM aims at promoting location as well as crop specific sustainable soil health management including residue management, organic farming practices by way of creating and linking soil
              fertility maps with macro - micro nutrient management, appropriate land use based on land capability, judicious application of fertilizers and minimizing the soil erosion/degradation. Assistance will be provided for various improved
              package of practices based on land use and soil characteristics, generated through geographical information system (GIS) based thematic maps and database on land and soil characteristics through extensive field level scientific
              surveys. <p>
          </li><br>
          <p><b>Neem Coated Urea (NCU)</b></p>
          <ul>
            <li>This scheme is initiated to regulate use of urea, enhance availability of nitrogen to the crop and reduce cost of fertilizer application.  NCU slows down the release of fertilizer and makes it available to the crop in an effective
              manner. The entire quantity of domestically manufactured and imported urea is now neem coated. It reduces the cost of cultivation and improves soil health management. </li>
          </ul><br>
          <p><b>Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)</b>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>It was launched on 1st July, 2015 with the motto of ‘Har Khet Ko Paani’ for providing end-to end solutions in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources, distribution network and farm level applications.
                  PMKSY not only focuses on creating sources for assured irrigation, but also creating protective irrigation by harnessing rain water at micro level through ‘Jal Sanchay’ and ‘Jal Sinchan’.
                  Micro irrigation is to be popularised to ensure ‘Per drop-More crop’. PMKSY adopts State level planning and projectised execution that allows States to draw up their own irrigation development based on District Irrigation Plans and
                  State Irrigation Plans.

              </ul><br>
              <p><b>Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)</b></p>
              <ul>
                <li>PMFBY is an actuarial premium based scheme under which farmer has to pay maximum premium of 2% for Kharif, 1.5% for Rabi food & oilseed crops and 5% for annual commercial/horticultural crops and remaining part of the
                  actuarial/bidded premium is shared equally by the Centre and State Government. One of the objectives of the scheme is to facilitate prompt claims settlement. The claims must be settled within two months of harvest subject to timely
                  provision of both yield data and share of premium subsidy by the State Government. </li>
